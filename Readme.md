## üß† AI Integration Strategy  

We plan to leverage AI throughout the development lifecycle to maximize productivity and ensure clean, maintainable code.  

### 1. **Code Generation**  
- Use AI (ChatGPT/GPT-5) to scaffold boilerplate for FastAPI routes, React components, and database models.  
- Employ CLI or IDE agents for repetitive tasks such as CRUD endpoints, data validation, and form handling.  

### 2. **Testing**  
- Generate **unit and integration tests** with AI assistance.  
- AI prompts will be used to ensure coverage for edge cases (e.g., invalid inputs, expired tokens).  
- Use test-driven development (TDD) workflows where AI helps draft test cases before implementation.  

### 3. **Documentation**  
- AI will help generate:  
  - **Docstrings** for functions, models, and routes.  
  - **Inline comments** explaining logic in complex sections.  
  - **README.md and reflection.md** with clear, human-readable project context.  

### 4. **Context-Aware Techniques**  
- Provide AI with **API specs, file trees, and git diffs** to generate accurate, context-aware updates.  
- AI will assist in writing **commit messages**, **changelogs**, and **developer notes** based on project state.  
- Use AI to suggest UI/UX improvements by analyzing screenshots of the frontend.
